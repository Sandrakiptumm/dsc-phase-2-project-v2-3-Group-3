 # Demystifying House Sales Analysis with Regression Modeling in a Northwestern County

## Project Overview
Business Understanding
The real estate market is a vital component of regional economic health and stability. This project delves into the dynamics of house sales in a specific northwestern county in the United States, aiming to unravel the key factors influencing property valuation in this area.


## Problem Statements

<li> What are the most significant factors influencing house prices in this northwestern county?

<li> How can we quantify the relationship between these factors and property value?

<li> Can we develop a reliable model to predict house prices based on relevant characteristics?


## Challenges

1. Real estate data complexity, encompassing diverse property features and local market trends.
2. Accurately identifying and quantifying the impact of each factor on house prices.
3. Consideration of external factors like economic conditions and interest rates.

## Proposed Solutions

Utilizing multiple linear regression, a powerful machine learning technique, to analyze a large dataset of house sales and identify statistical relationships between property features and sale prices.

## Objectives

1. Develop a robust multiple linear regression model for accurate house price prediction.
2. Identify significant factors influencing property value in the specific market.
3. Provide insights into regional housing market dynamics.

## Research Questions

<li> How do bedrooms, bathrooms, grade, and square footage correlate with sale price in King County?
<li> What increase in home value can homeowners expect after specific renovation projects?
<li> Which renovation projects have the greatest impact on a home's market value?
<li> Are there specific combinations of renovation projects that provide an interdependent effect on home value?

## Data Understanding

**Dataset Description**

The analysis utilizes the King County House Sales dataset, comprising over 21,500 records and 20 distinct features. Spanning house sales from May 2014 to May 2015, the dataset offers a comprehensive snapshot of the housing market.

**Key Columns**

<li> id: Unique identifier for a house
<li> date: Date of house sale
<li> price: Sale price (prediction target)
<li> bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living, sqft_lot, floors, view, condition, grade, sqft_above, sqft_basement, yr_built, yr_renovated, zipcode, sqft_living15, sqft_lot15, sell_yr

**Constraints and Considerations**

<li> Data may contain anomalies or inconsistencies necessitating careful examination.
<li> Time frame (May 2014 - May 2015) may not fully reflect current market dynamics.
<li> Scope of data may not capture external factors such as interest rates or economic climate influencing property values.
